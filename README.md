The main goal in this project was to visualize information that has been saved on top of a new technology named blockchain.

In the system, all the information about products and all the transactions that ever happened in the system, are recorded on the blockchain. Then, data was retrieved from the blockchain and used to visualize provenance of products on Google Map API.

The main technologies used in this system are Rinkeby Network, React.js, Web3.js and MetaMask.
